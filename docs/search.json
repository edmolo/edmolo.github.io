My research primarily focuses on understanding the social and contextual factors that underly personality development. I am especially interested in the role that geography plays in personality development. Other interests include trait assessment and social network dynamics, with a focus on factors that predict relationship dissolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of my research, I enjoy NBA basketball, spending time with my dog, Mike, and reading science fiction and fantasy."
