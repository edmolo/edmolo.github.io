    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> I am an undergraduate at KU, studying social psychology and graduating in May 2024. I am a forthcoming Ph.D. student of Dr. Erin Hennes at Mizzou. At the broadest
    level, I am interested in the psychological processes behind motivation and belief formation: Why do people do what they do, and why do they believe what they believe? I am also very intersted in perceptions of societal change. </p>

    <p> I am especially intringed by these questions in the context of social justice and the media. Basic questions that I might ask may look like, "Why do people believe some sources of information and not others?" "Why, despite contemporary technological
        wonders, do people generally think society is in decline? Currently, I am very interested in novel sources of news, such as reddit forums, TikTok, etc. I am interested in how certain design choices (i.e. users only seeing 'likes,' or 'upvotes,' influences how
        individuals perceive these messages.</p>
    <p> My most recent work (pictured to the left) examines how doomsday, or end-times messages, influence people's goals. Results suggest that exposure to sensationalized messaging about existential
    issues like climate change shortens an individual's appraisal of how long they have left to live, and therefore decreases their willingness to engage in long-term goal pursuit. This work won a prestigious undergraduate research award from KU, and subsequently KU's Courtwright award for research excellence.</p>

    <p> In my free time, I enjoy NBA basketball, lifting weights, reading science fiction/fantasy, and spending time with my dog, Mike. </p>
