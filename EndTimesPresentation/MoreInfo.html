        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Since 2019, online communities dedicated to discussion about imminently forthcoming end-times have grown exponentially. In 2018, the paradigmatic discourse community of this phenomenon, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse">r/collpase</a>, has grown from approximately 85,196 users in December 2018, to 494,350 in December, 2023.
            This growth is remarkable on its own terms. However, the story doesn't stop here. Across the same timeframe, the number of
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/wiki/assistantbot_statistics/#wiki_traffic">unique</a> visitors, or visitors to the forum who's IP address (a unique address used by a website to identify an individual's device on the internet) had not been logged previously, also
            experienced exponential growth. Starting at 144,497 in December 2018, the estimated unique visitors to the forum for December 2023 is 433,328. For each unique visitor, the number of pageviews, or individual posts they clicked on and viewed is also collected. Over this interval, individuals arriving in this forum viewed an average ranging from 11 to as high as 24 posts.
        </p>

        <p>These numbers are important. Academics and the broader public have a tendency to say that end-times beliefs arcoss individuals are perhaps not very important; that those who think the world is about to end are kooks and normal, reasonable people are unlikely to be influenced by such messaging. Unfortunatly, this data present reason to question the conventional wisdom. That seemingly delusional
        and irrational beliefs are reaching such a large number of people; that people are seeing this information and then subscribing to these forums to see more, is a concerning phenomenon. An additional layer of complexity is added upon consideration of internal data collected by the forum's moderation team about their subscribers. These forum moderators have conducted two surveys of their subscribers in 2021, and 2023.
            <!-- TODO insert the images -->
            In 2023, the moderation team lauched a 60 item survey to collect the opinions of their subscribers. They recieved responses from a total of 1223 individuals. I would not describe these as reliable results, however, they paint an intersting picture nonetheless. In the 2023 survey, people reported becomeing, "collapse aware," due in part to the online community itself. Respondents also mentioned "Discussion with Collapse aware individuals," as an important factor. The largest feature, however, is self-reported observation in climate change.
            Curiously, this sample reported being highly educaiton: Nearly 60% of resondents report having a bachelor's degree or beyond. Indeed, upon examination of those who endorse beliefs related to the endtimes, the conventional wisdom suggest that these people are not simply foolish, but that their beliefs may be due to underlying psychological and sociological processes.
        </p>

        <p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that those exposed to a contrived end times message would shorten the time horizons of those exposed, and discount delayed outcomes at a greater rate than those exposed to a similar form of sesantionalized messaging.</p>

    <div class="method">
        <h2> Method</h2>
        To test our hypotheses, we developed a survey in Qualtrics. Participants (N = 141) were randomly assigned to view either an end-times message contrived by the research team, or a message suggesting a sensational increase in campus crime. Both messages were approximatel equal in length, and eqaual in number of comments and likes. These posts were designed to appear as if they were posted on r/Crime or r/Collapse by scraping posts from the respective forums. After recieving their assigned message, participants were prompted with several items to ensure they read their posts and support the cover story: That we were interested in public opinion of social media. After completing these cover story questions, participants were asked to complete Carstensen's 10 item future time
        perspective scale. Then, they were asked to complete Kirby's 27-item Monetary Choice Questionnaire. Participants were then prompted for demograohic information. If you would like to see the survey, or more detailed information about these measures, please click

    <h2>Results, Implications, and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        The results of this initial experiment paint an interesting picture. On one hand, those exposed to our end-times message indeed reported a shorter appraisal of future time. On the other hand, they did not discount delayed outcomes at a greater rate. Socioemotional Selectivity Theory predicts that individuals with a shortened appraisal of future time should make present-oriented choices more often that long-term oreiented choices (Carstensen et al., 1999). We believed that this would translate to intertemporal choice, as measured by the 27-item MCQ, which measures how quickly the subjective value of a reward decreases (Kirby & MarakoviĆ, 1996).
        The 27-item MCQ is robustly related to short term and hedonistic decisions, such as taking drugs, etc. Thus, it cannot be concluded at this time that individuals with a shortened time appraisal make different choices regarding their future. However, end times messages do appear to shorten temporal horizons.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are several reasons why this might be the case. The first is that our sample, being slightly older than what we wished, naturally experience shortened future-time appraisals, as they are actually closer to the end of their lives. Another limitation may have been due to demand effects. The 27-item MCQ is routinely administered to prolific participants, and multiple participants reported knowing what it is used to measure. Additionally, there is evidence that delay-discounting may not be an adequate tool to examine intertemporal choice in this context. Some evidence suggests that discount rates may be specific to individuals, and not subject to much variance within individuals and across situations (Odum, 2011).
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite these challenges, that end-times messaging reduced the time perspective of participants is significant. This indicates that opinion crafters and journalists should take care in reporting issues like climate change. These individuals are caught in a bind: On one hand, flashy headlines about existential issues like climate change draw a large audience. On the other hand, such headlines may undermine the goals of those producing them by creating a sense of hopelessness in their audience. For instance, climate change is a collective action problem. To make any degree of climate progress, it is necessary for many people to think long term and be open to developing new realationships and communities. However, those
        with shortened horizons of future time tend to maximize emotional pleasure and lessen their purusit of long-term goals like those that underscore collective action problems. Such articles are shared prolifically in online spaces like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse">r/collpase</a>, and a sort of telephone-game of sensationalization unfolds–resulting in the messages featured in the forum.  It is also of note that such online spcaes may function as social attack surfaces (stacy dissertation): Spheres of influence upon which western adversaries may seek to undermine public trust in critical institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Future directions will include examining if future time perspective is moderated by individual delay discounting rates. Further, SST predicts that individuals with shortened time horizons will maximize the experience of emotional pleasure. As such, the presence of nostaligia-laden speech may provide further support for Carstensen's SST. Finally, personality characteristics such as Bullshit Receptivity may predict belief in end-times messaging.
