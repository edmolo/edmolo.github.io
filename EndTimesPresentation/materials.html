        <h2>27-item Monetary Choice Questionaire</h2>
        <p>The 27-item MCQ allows researchers to estimate delay discounting rates of a sample (k).
        Participants are presented with a length of time, and then the option to choose a small immediate
        reward, or a large delayed reward. The reward and delay are related such that the subjective value of both
        options is equivalent. If a participant chooses the small, immediate reward, then, it can be inferred that the
        participant's k-value at that question is less than the hypothetical value of that question.</p>
        <p>There are nine levels of hypothetical k-values. Participants are assessed on each hypothetical
        three times. During analysis, responses are examined for consistency. In our sample, overall consistency of reward choice was
        approximately 96.97%. This indicates that people were choosing options that consistently represent how they are thinking about future choice.</p>

        <h2>Future Time Perspective</h2>
        <p>This measure is Dr. Laura Carstens's 10 item scale that measures subjective appraisal of future time. In other words, the scale measures how much longer participants believe they have to live. Pariticpants rate how true items are for them at this moment on a five item Likert scale. The original measure uses seven items. We adapted this to five items to decrease respondents' cognitive burden.</p>

    <h2>Other measures</h2>
    <p>Data was also collected on how long participants spent on each page of the survey. The number of clicks made by participants was also collected. This information will be used in subsequent analysis. Carstensen's Socioemotional selectivity theory predictas that individuals with shortened horizon of future time will spend less time making decisions. This translates to an examination of how long participants spent between conditions, and how many clicks they made as representative of choices. For instance, if one's horizon of future time is decreased, one would expect that they click less and advance through the survey faster. Preliminary analysis suggests that there was not a significant difference between conditions on total time spent in the survey.</p>
