    <h1>Our Data</h1>
    <p>If you would like to see our data in order to rerun our analyses or just to check it out, you can get an overview here.</p>
    <p>There are several methods by which you can obtain this. The way you are likely most comfortable with is through OSF. To navigate there, click
        <a href="todo">here</a></p>
    <!--    TODO add link to OSF page-->
    <p>Alternatively, you may download it from github. This can be achieved through the command line <!--TODO cmd instructions for windows and mac--> or by going to this link, <!--TODO add link to github--> clicking the green box located directly next to 'code' and clicking download zip. Then you must extract the zip file into your file system</p>
    <p> Another way to get this data is by scraping it, if you are more comfortable doing that. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to download, move, or store anything on your device. This requires python.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have not already, type 'pip install pandas' into your IDE.</li>
        <li>Once installed, type: import pandas as pd</li>
        <li>On the next line, type: df = pd.read_html('<!--TODO addlink to html representation of data-->')</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data can then be analyzed in python, or easily exported as a single csv. The drawbacks of this approach are that you will have to come up with your own method of examining Delay Discounting. The most intuitive tool for this is likely the tool that I used. It is an excel spreadsheet hosted by the University of Kansas, designed by KU faculty. To use this tool, you must transform response options to 0 and 1. The small, immediate reward choices are coded in the data as '1' and the long, delayed reward choices are coded as '2'. The spreadsheet tool only works for ones and twos. Simply paste the data into the spreadsheet, and use the find and replace tool to replace these values. You must first change the 1's to 0's, and then change the 2's to 1's.
