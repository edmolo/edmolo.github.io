    <p id="p1"> I am pursuing a career as a social psychologist. I am interested in a range of topics,
        but especially those related to individuals' beliefs and motivations. At the broadest level, I ask questions
        like, "How do feelings influence one's beliefs about people and
        society at large?" "What motivates people to participate in society?"
        "How do our every day social norms guide behavior, and what happens when those norms are undermined?"
    </p>
    <p id="p2">
        So far, my research has examined belief formation, and the motivational consequences
        of seeing messages about the end of the world. In asking these questions, I employ a variety
        of methods that range from working directly with research participants in a laboratory and conducting survey experiments,
        to harvesting big data from social media companies like Reddit.
    </p>
    <p id="p3">
    I also have adjunctive interests in philosophy, education, government, and artificial intelligence.
        I love science fiction/fantasy, the NBA, my dog Mike, and many other things that you can read all about on
        my <a href="https://www.example.com">blog.</a>
